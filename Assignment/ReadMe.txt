First I need to run the cmd program as an admin and then I will go to the folder where I saved the Assignment.any 
in my case: C:\Users\raeann\Downloads\AnyBody Folder\Assignment
To run the console I can point where it is saved in the instal

To run the Assignment.any and to print the Assignmentoutput.anydata.h5
C:\Users\raeann\Downloads\AnyBody Folder\Assignment>"C:\Program Files\AnyBody Technology\AnyBody.8.0\AnyBodyCon.exe" /m "runmacro.anymcr"


To run the Assignment.any only
C:\Users\raeann\Downloads\AnyBody Folder\Assignment>"C:\Program Files\AnyBody Technology\AnyBody.8.0\AnyBodyCon.exe" /m "ExeMacro.anymcr"
